# Shared Subflow: Setup Test Data
#
# This subflow prepares the test environment with necessary data.
# Run this before executing test suites that require specific data setup.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - User must be logged in as sponsor (for creating tasks)
# - Test accounts must exist in database
#
# This subflow:
# - Creates sample tasks for sponsee
# - Creates sample messages between sponsor and sponsee
# - Generates invite codes
# - Sets up relationship data
#
# Usage:
# - runFlow: flows/shared/_setup-test-data.yaml
#
# Post-conditions:
# - Test data is ready for test execution

# This is a placeholder for future implementation
# In Phase 1, we're documenting the structure
# Actual implementation will be done when specific tests require it

# Future implementation will include:
# 1. Create sample tasks via API or UI
# 2. Create sample messages
# 3. Generate invite codes
# 4. Set up relationships
# 5. Seed step progress data

# For now, we'll just verify we're logged in
