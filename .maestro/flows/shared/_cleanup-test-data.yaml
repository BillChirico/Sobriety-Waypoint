# This is a placeholder for future implementation
# In Phase 1, we're documenting the structure
# Actual implementation will be done when specific tests require it

# Future implementation will include:
# 1. Navigate to tasks and delete test tasks
# 2. Navigate to messages and clear conversations
# 3. Remove test relationships
# 4. Clear notifications
# 5. Delete temporary test accounts (if created during tests)

# For now, we'll just log that cleanup was called
